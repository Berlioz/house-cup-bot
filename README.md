# Sigmabot
AKA: Stufflebot
Formerly known as: the house cup bot (for Harry Potter fandoms)

A discord bot to do all sorts of random things. Most of the things this bot does was inspired by requests from people in discord servers I'm active in. Many people contributed creatively to this bot, which is why it's now named Sigmabot, to represent the sum of all the contributors.

General rules for the original house cup contest are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z03xR7jpi-oXwmI9N1XpU6N90BnXmj5ptyASdWnIkNA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Getting Started With Coding

After you pull the code, you will need to do the following.

1. Set an environment variable with the token for your test discord bot. You can do this with:

```
export DISCORD_BOT_SECRET='TOKEN'
```

2. Create a test data base. If you're interested in contributing code, let me know, and I'll write a script to initialize this.

3. Then you should be able to run the bot with `python bot.py`. Make sure to use Python 3.6.
