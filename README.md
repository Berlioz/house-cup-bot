# house-cup-bot
AKA: Stufflebot

A discord bot to run the House Cup Competition. This was built for a Harry Potter fanfiction writing group.

General rules for the contest are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z03xR7jpi-oXwmI9N1XpU6N90BnXmj5ptyASdWnIkNA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Getting Started

After you pull the code, you will need to do the following.

1. Set an environment variable with the token for your discord bot. You can do this with:

```
export DISCORD_BOT_SECRET='TOKEN'
```
 Run this in your terminal and then also add this line to your `.bashrc`.

2. Create a file named `data.json` with `{}` inside of it.

3. Then you should be able to run the bot with `python bot.py`. Make sure to use Python 3.6.
